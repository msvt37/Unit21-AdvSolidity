# Objective 
The purpose of this project was to create an ERC20 coin called PupperCoin and through the use of a crowdsale, raise funds for the creation of the network.

The crowdsale should raise a max of 300 Ether and can run for up to 24 weeks.

Buyer will send Ether and receive PupperCoin back in one transaction.  

PupperCoin.Sol provides the definition for the PupperCoin

The Crowdsale.sol defines the contract for the crowdsale
![Crowd](https://github.com/msvt37/Unit21-AdvSolidity/blob/main/DeployCrowd.PNG)

The crowdsale should be deployed to the Kovan or Ropsten network.
